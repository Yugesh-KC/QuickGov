Honorable Home Minister Bal Krishna Khan and Secretary of the Ministry Shree Tek Narayan Pandey,
visited Police Headquarters Nakshel for an inspection tour.

During the inspection tour, Secretary of the Ministry Shree Tek Narayan Pandey expressed his respect for the police personnel who sacrifice their lives for the welfare of the country and the people. He then stated that the police personnel should contribute by being in the forefront when the state is in crisis, that the police have an important role in ensuring the implementation of the laws enacted by the state, and that changes are also necessary in the thinking and structure of the police to deal with the new trends emerging in increasing urbanization, social and environmental changes and criminal activities. He directed that efforts be focused on integrating the transfer system of the police, career development, job security and opportunities, and on building a strong police organization with capable, honest and dedicated individuals.

During the inspection tour, Honorable Home Minister Bal Krishna Khan appreciated the multifaceted role played by Nepal Police despite limited resources, low manpower and inadequate physical infrastructure. He said that the government is positive about the service facilities of the police personnel, the construction of physical infrastructure and increasing the capacity of the organization. He also appreciated the role played by the police in the COVID-19 pandemic and disasters. It seems that technology should be used to improve the effectiveness of controlling the increasing security challenges in the state and the increasing criminal activities in the society, and the capacity of the manpower should be increased, as the behavior of security personnel at the workplace shapes the public's perception of the government. In recent days, it has been necessary to be more sensitive to the violence against women and children. It seems that if the experience of former security officials can be used for the nation in relation to crime control and security, it can help the organization achieve success, keep the morale of the security personnel high, make the organization strong and capable, and use rewards and punishments correctly to strengthen the organization and make it strong and capable.

On the occasion, Inspector General of Police Mr. Shailesh Thapa Kshetri made a brief presentation on the work being done by the police and expressed his commitment to increasing the welfare of the police organization, professional commitment and adherence to financial discipline. He expressed gratitude for the important and meaningful directives received from the Honorable Minister and the Secretary, and expressed his hope that the police organization will get more energy from the current political leadership. The program was completed.

It is well known that the role of the press as the fourth pillar of the state is important in promoting transparency, accountability and maintaining good governance. In order to carry out the mentioned role effectively, the media itself must be impartial, dignified and professional, the Ministry has taken serious note of the fact that some media have published/broadcasted completely fabricated, misleading and factless news stories involving this Ministry and its subordinate departments and security agencies. The deliberate publication/broadcast of baseless and misleading news is a shameful and regrettable matter in terms of the conduct and professionalism of the media. Constructive journalism is a mirror for governance and good governance. Such constructive news and comments always serve as feedback for the Ministry. Factless and misleading information and news have a negative impact on the general security system and state security system.

In this context, a 5-member investigation committee was formed under the decision of the Prison Management Department under the chairmanship of Mr. Jharendra Prasad Chapagain, Director of the department, to investigate and ascertain the facts. The committee submitted its report to the department on 2079/02/16. The report has not yet been received by this Ministry; and it is requested that once it is received, it will be studied and action will be taken against the guilty and reform measures will be implemented.

It has been observed in the context that 'the inmates hide their identity; give false identity; hide their identity and the inmates keep exchanging and swapping their imprisonment, a prisoner serves the imprisonment of another prisoner due to love and temptation'; As such, the subject matter is not only an internal matter of prison management but also related to overall aspects of prison management. Therefore, a central level investigation committee is necessary to submit a report including measures to investigate, inquire and study and research to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future and to improve prison management. Therefore, the following five-member investigation committee has been constituted under the decision of the Government of Nepal, Ministry of Home Affairs (Honorable Home Minister level) dated 2079/02/7 and to this effect, all concerned are requested to take note.

Notice

Complaints and information are being received about Nepali citizens who have gone abroad on visit visas recently facing various difficulties such as being stranded, not getting work, being denied entry from the destination country, and being returned. A visit visa is meant solely for tourism purposes and not for working, laboring, or employment abroad. Therefore, the number of people going abroad on visit visas with the intention of finding work or getting employed is increasing and they are facing problems such as not getting work and being stranded.

In such cases, the government of Nepal has no legal basis to provide insurance, compensation, and relief to citizens who have gone abroad illegally and faced problems and such individuals face even greater difficulties. Nepali citizens who wish to go abroad to work must complete the required procedures, including obtaining labor approval from the relevant authority, according to the prevailing laws. It is requested that you inquire and consult to ensure that any family member who is going abroad has completed all the necessary procedures. It is also requested that local levels make arrangements to register citizens going abroad for tourism or employment within their jurisdiction and provide necessary legal procedures, facilitation, and counseling. The ministry sincerely requests that those traveling abroad on visit visas use their visas solely for tourism purposes and not fall into the trap of lucrative employment and work opportunities using visit visas.

In order to make the work of distributing Nepali citizenship and managing related records more systematic and technology-based, a system has been implemented where local bodies will use the Central Citizenship Information Management System http://1000.8 to make recommendations to the respective District Administration, Sub-district Administration and Border Administration Offices to issue new Nepali citizenship certificates through an online system. In the initial phase, this system will be implemented in all 18 ward offices of Gaindakot Municipality under Nawalparasi (Bardaghat Susta East) district from 2080 Chaitra 15 and will be gradually implemented in other local bodies based on their requests and preparedness.

The Ministry believes that the implementation of the system of recommending citizenship through the online system from the ward office of the local level itself will control illegal activities such as false, forged, and duplicate recommendations in the citizenship recommendation process, save time for the District Administration, Sub-district Administration, Border Administration Offices, local bodies/ward offices, and service recipients, and contribute to the promotion of electronic governance along with central record management.

Local bodies wishing to join the system and provide electronic services are requested to contact the respective District Administration Office and make necessary preparations.
