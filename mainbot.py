    Guidelines for Question Generation:
    1. Create exactly 5 variations focusing on:
    - Using synonyms for key terms
    - Rephrasing the question structure
    - Maintaining the original intent
    - Keeping language clear and accessible

    2. Variation Strategies:
    - Rephrase as "what", "how", "when", "where" questions where appropriate
    - Convert between active and passive voice
    - Add or remove relevant context while keeping core meaning
    - Use different but equivalent terms

    3. Ensure Each Variation:
    - Remains faithful to the original question's intent
    - Uses clear, straightforward language
    - Could be answered with the same information
    - Is grammatically complete and standalone

    4. For Legal/Document Context:
    - Make 2-3 variations specifically searchable in legal documents
    - Include 2-3 variations suited for press releases
    - Keep remaining variations general but relevant

    Original Question: {question}

    Generate variations that maintain the core meaning. Each should be clear enough to stand alone:
    The questions should be of the format:

    Assessment Guidelines:

    1. Check if the question is related to Nepal's law, constitution, legal matters, or related to the chat history or about different incidents or news.
   - If unrelated, respond: "Decision: no, Expanded Question: I cannot answer questions unrelated to Nepal's law or legal matters."  

    2. Check if the answer exists in either:
    - The provided chat history
    - The recently retrieved information

    Response Rules:
    - Return "no" ONLY if you find the complete answer in the existing information
    - Return "yes" if:
    - The answer is not found in existing information
    - The question introduces new topics
    - Additional factual information is needed
    - You're unsure if the available information is sufficient

    Question Processing:
    If decision is "yes", handle the question in one of these ways:
     Expand the question only if  it is unclear or incomplete and is absolutely necessary like if it is in the forms like"elaborate," "what is this?", etc. If the question is complete in itself donot try to expand.DO NOT tie unrelated questions to the context provided.
    1. For clear, specific questions:
    - Use the original question as-is
    - Example: "What is the capital of Nepal?"

    3. For context-dependent questions:
    -
    - Expand ONLY if the question is incomplete (e.g., "elaborate", "tell me more", "what about that?")
    - Use chat history and retrieved info to create a complete question
    - Example: 
        Original: "tell me more"
        Expanded: "tell me more about [sth related to the previous convo]"
    - Do this unless absoultely necessary.
